- vim.g is read-only.
- vim.opt_global isn't read only, BUT it returns an Option you have to unpack.
- vim.o is probably what you want to use for most things.
(:h lua-vim-options)

WARNING: doing a top-level "vim.o.setting = value" statement will usually work,
but seems to break when opening multiple files from the command line:
("vim file1 file2 file3"). only the first buffer will receive these top-level
settings. for this case, you'll want to use a BufEnter autocommand / ftplugin
(or just NEVER EVER open multiple files at once from the command line and you
should be fine).

- 'expandtab' will replace a tab *keypress* with several space *bytes*
- 'tabstop' is the number of characters displayed on screen for each tab byte
- 'shiftwidth' is the number of characters on screen that your cursor will jump
  forward when you press the tab key or use < > motions.
- 'softtabstop' i don't know how to explain but basically it affects <tab> and
  <bs> when other text exists. see example below.

NOTE 'softtabstop' example. if your 'sts' is set to 4, then pressing <bs> while
in insert mode at the beginning of "hello," you will see the following change:
hi there        hello again
hi there    hello again
(it deletes four spaces, even in the middle of a line. if sts is 0, this action
would delete a single space.)

WARNING: if expandtab, don't let your tabstop exceed your shiftwidth.
otherwise, you'll have chunks of spaces turn into tabs once they get longer.
with (ts=8 sw=4) a single tab press does this:
____text goes here
the second tab press does this:
>       text goes here

WARNING: if expandtab, don't let your shiftwidth exceed your tabstop.
otherwise, you'll be indenting with multiple tab bytes per indentation level.
at that point, you might as well use spaces.
with (ts=4 sw=8) a single tab press does this:
>   >   text goes here

TL;DR use the same value for ts, sw, and sts. then, 'expandtab' is the only
thing you need to change to flip between tabs and spaces. when reading someone
else's files, you're just gonna have to make do.

-- recall: autocommands of the same event type will fire in order of definition

--[[

here's the deal with buffer settings and autocommands:

i find it REALLY annoying that ftplugin/ and after/ftplugin are evaluated before
the BufEnter event, as there are buffer-settings i would like to apply for every
non-ftplugin-ified buffer. but i can't AFAIK. also, to add to the confusion, the
order of autocommand events is apparently not well defined, so depending on
whether you're opening a new file, existing file, the first file within a vim
session, or a subsequent file, things can spiral out of control quickly.

the obvious solution is to apply generic options first, *then* specific ones to
override them. but by loading ftplugins before BufEnter events, vim is backwards

the solution is this:
- global settings just go in init.lua (or file required by init.lua) like normal
- filetype settings go in the after/ftplugin, along with a buffer variable
  indicating that some settings have been changed
- buffer local settings are defined in a BufEnter autocommand, buf gated by the
  aforementioned buffer variable

you probably could create some sort of automated framework for this, but i'm
trying to keep my config as minimal as possible, so this will have to do ðŸ˜ ðŸ’¢
